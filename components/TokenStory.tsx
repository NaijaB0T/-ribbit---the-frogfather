            In the swampy underbelly of the Solana blockchain, where rug pulls lurk and paper hands tremble, a legend was born.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            A frog like no other.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            He wasn't like the others chasing pumps or licking chartsâ€”no, he was patient, strategic, and ruthless when necessary. They called him... <strong className="text-green-400">The Frogfather</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            He rose from humble pond beginnings, trading frogspawn for early NFTs and stacking SOL before it was cool. He watched as frogkind was laughed at, memed, ruggedâ€”and still, he stayed. Waited. Plotted.
