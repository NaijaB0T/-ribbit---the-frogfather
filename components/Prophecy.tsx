          Legend has it that $RIBBIT will sound the trumpet of the next bull market. <strong className="text-green-400">‚ÄúWhen the Frogfather croaks,"</strong> the prophecy says, <strong className="text-green-400">‚Äúgreen candles will light the skies once again.‚Äù</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Until that day, the Mafia gathers strength, staking $RIBBIT, spreading memes, recruiting loyal frogs, and expanding their turf across Telegram and X.
        </p>
        <p>
          But beware... the <strong className="text-orange-400">Cat Cartel</strong>, the <strong className="text-yellow-400">Shiba Syndicate</strong>, and even the <strong className="text-lime-400">Pepe Pretenders</strong> have marked $RIBBIT for war. What they don't know is: <strong className="text-red-500">you don't challenge the Frogfather and live to tell the tale.</strong>
